title: Food History - Snout to Tail Living (with a recipe)
description: >-
  I think you will find with regards to things like bacon and sausage, it
  actually came from ensuring every part of the animal is consumed or used.
  Fatback, bacon - all of these undesirable meat cuts were made palatable and
  consumed - think of scrapple, head cheese, and in the deep south - chitlings -
  the idea was that nothing went to waste and it was a large part of why pigs
  became so popular - and still are very popular - in quite a few cultures. The
  bones can serve a stock or as a source of gelatin - ground up bone meal as
  used for a number of things and we can't forget bone marrow. The skin could be
  used for so many different things from a protective layer to help preserve
  meat not to mention tanned for leather. 60 or 70 years ago and beyond these
  pigs we are raising today people would have turned a nose up at - simply not
  enough lard and meat that was waaay too lean. When I recently had a pig done I
  told the butcher how excited I was to get the lard, particularly the leaf
  lard. I was really looking forward to rendering the lard. One of the most
  valuable parts of a pig had always been the lard - the lard could do so much
  in so many different ways and it really was a vital component to survival well
  into the 20th century. I was both astonished and befuddled when the butcher
  came out of his back room with about ten pounds of fresh leaf lard for me. He
  told me that nobody wants this stuff and that they use what they need for
  sausage and throw out the rest. WHAT!!! They throw out the most valuable part
  of the pig? Only in 2016 do we take something like pig lard, that requires
  very very little rendering to transform it into a valuable product and throw
  it out. I don’t see anybody throwing away barrels of oil, after all it is a
  commodity, so what happened to pig fat? Crisco killed the importance of lard
  and in order for Crisco to be successful they had to engage in millions of
  dollars worth of a smear campaign against lard. The funny part of the story is
  that Crisco is rendered from an inedible (and I think maybe even toxic before
  processing) seed - the cotton seed. When the cotton seed is pressed it creates
  an inedible red oil - that red oil is then processed substantially - actually
  it is crystallized (hence the name "Crisco" the Cri is a derivation of
  crystallized oils needed to make it) and then hydrogenated for preservation --
  this machine created white grease was what was allegedly so much better than
  lard - and the smear campaign worked. It wasn't long before every 1960's
  kitchen had a can of Crisco and by the 1970 the "canned convenience"
  generation had taken full hold of the nation. See, in the 1960's your Mom
  would go to the market and purchase food fresh and locally - probably most
  days of the week. We had better connected interpersonal relationships back
  then because of the makeup of the community and the fact that you were out and
  about everyday running your errands - it was a full time job - as most 1960's
  housewives (which are becoming harder and harder to find) would attest to -
  but I suppose that is a discussion for another day. The point is if the 1960's
  was the fresh generation the 1970's was certainly the canned generation.
  Everyone was ecstatic about shelf life, convenience and totally ignorant about
  preservatives, hydrogenated oils, and corn syrup. To make it even better,
  prices were dropping. The benefit of highly preserved food was that it lasted
  longer on the shelves, which translated to a longer selling time - which meant
  that in the big scheme of things it was actually cheaper for the consumer to
  purchase - and certainly cheaper if you added in shelf life at home and the
  freedom it gave you from having to go to the market everyday - truly the
  1970’s were the beginning of the end of “real food”. As a side note, the
  1970’s were also responsible for ushering in the rise of corn syrup and its
  ultimate replacement of sugar in nearly every item consumed - its worth
  mentioning that the rise of corn syrup was linked closely to politics,
  subsidies, and commodity prices but again that is a different conversation. Ok
  - back from our short detour there down memory lane. We began this discussion
  talking about certain meat product and their consumption and my point was that
  if we look at some of these meat products, specifically those from pigs, that
  we will most likely find their origins in necessity and the importance of
  utilizing the entire animal. Sausage, for example, was made from parts and
  pieces that would otherwise be inedible, unpalatable, or both - or maybe just
  trimmings from better cuts. You can do two things here - you can toss away
  those bits and pieces or you can throw them in a grinder with a little pork
  fat, add some spices, some smoke, and in some cases time - and you end up with
  a fantastically tasty and edible product of value. We discussed the use of the
  bones, the head, obviously the cuts of meat, and now the scrap pieces and
  seemingly inedible bits - but what about all that lard?There are two
  distinctly different types of pig. Lard pigs tend to be short of body length
  and put on a lot of fat easily. Lard pigs tend to grow more slowly and not as
  large structurally. Meat or “bacon” pigs have longer bodies and also have
  higher levels of muscling. These pigs are fast growing and are much larger -
  like twice the size of their lard relatives. Obviously you can make a bacon
  pig fat by over feeding it - but we are talking about unadulterated natural
  tendencies here. (Just as a side note - take a look at the ears of the boar
  (male pig) below. Do you see those notches? We don’t do it on our farm yet but
  this is how pigs are marked and identified - with ear notches. Tags are
  sometimes used but notches last forever).

At Overlook Acres we raise American Guinea Hogs (AGH) - besides having supple amounts of lard the meat is tastier, moister, and altogether different than the traditional "Other White Meat." In fact, the AGH has often been called the Kobe beef of pork for its lush red marbled meat. I digress, the purpose of this conversation is LARD! The red colored Tamworth above would have been very difficult to find 60 or more years ago - it simply wasn't what people needed or wanted in a pig. Properly rendered lard from a lard pig yields copious amounts of snow white lard. The leaf lard, which is the lard up behind the Kidneys is the highest quality of lard in the pig and is rendered separately - at least at my house it is. Once rendered this flaky (when cold) snow white lard can be used to make the best pie crust known to man. The best of the lard is colorless, void if any piggy smell or taste, and has no second when it comes to baking, particularly when it comes to crust making. As you get closer and closer to the bottom of the pan of rendered lard the lard begins to take on an off white color and takes on more of a piggy smell and taste - you won't notice it unless you take a cooled jar of the snow white stuff and put it next to one of the last jars you fill - you will see a noticeable difference. This more "aromatic" lard is still great for savory dishes, particularly frying up eggs or anything else that the taste and smell actually works well with. I have found that there is also no substitute for frying - vegetable oil and shortening simply don't cut it, the smoke point is too low and you need to use something like more expensive peanut oil (which some have allergies to) to match the smoke point of lard. I will let you in on a little secret with regards to frying food. When the oil is very very hot it cooks the outside very quickly and seals it. If the oil is hot enough the oil never actually penetrates the food and it is actually the heat of the moisture within whatever it is your frying that cooks it. When oil is not hot enough the food item will continue to absorb the oil until you are left with a greasy pile of crap. Lard, for whatever reason also has a tendency to not splatter - I have no idea why, but even my wife commented on how "splatter resistant" lard seemed to be when frying items. The importance of Lard didn't stop at cooking though. That leaf lard I was discussing was sometimes refined even further into the finest cutting and mechanical oils - I believe they are still being used today and are quite expensive. The was a reason each family kept lard pigs as the standard "yard pig" - the lard was used everywhere. Mom used the lard in the kitchen, dad used the lard in the shop. Lard was used as the base for soap making (lard makes by far the creamiest soap - which also happens to be the best soap for your skin because the chemical composition of pig lard is closest to the fat directly under the skin), lard was used for making candles and again refined into oil (mixed with kerosene) for burning in oil lamps. Indeed, every single part of the animal was used, nothing went to waste. You can buy lard today at the store - but it isn't the same. First, it is rather expensive coming in at about $2.50-$3 per pound. Second, it is hydrogenated and its basic chemical composition altered for the purpose of making it shelf stable and extending its life - do yourself a favor if you want to use lard - render your own. You don't have to grow a pig to get yourself lard - just ask the butcher for it. You can probably walk away with pounds of unrefined lard for pennies on the dollar or even free. It is so very simple. Just cut the lard into cubes, set your crockpot on medium and just let it go. After a few hours you can check on it and scoop out the rendered lard - it will look almost clear. The first jar or two of lard you pull will be the cleanliest and best for pie ect. You just keep doing this until you are left with nothing but bits of meat that were mixed in with the fat. No comes the real treat - take those bits and transfer them to the frying pan and turn them golden brown and crispy. These bits are amazing on a salad. I hope you give lard a try and remember to use every part of the food items you purchase or raise. Even when I trim pork chops I make sure to get every piece of fat and meat off the bone and then I grind those trimmings into basically pork burger. I recently made 8 chops and there was probably a pound of trimmings that I turned into burger - which my wife later in the week mixed with hamburger to make the most amazing ziti. Before I go let me share a recipe with you that I made up the other night: This is basically my version of schnitzel-1 Box of Panko (Japanese Style) bread crumbs 2 Cups of Flour 3 Eggs beaten well 1/4 Cup of milk (whole preferred) 1 TSP Salt 1 TSP of Pepper 2 TSP of Paprika 1 TSP of Garlic Powder 1 TSP of Onion Powder 1 Cups (or so) of Rendered Lard - any quality 4-8 (depends on size) trimmed, boned, pork chops Your favorite seasoning (I like to use Cajun Seasoning) You take your trimmed and boned chops and a meat mallet and pound them flat to about 1/4" in width. At this point I rub them down with a generous portion of a cajun seasoning, you really won't get much from this seasoning once you cook it but rub down the chops then let them rest for a while. The longer you let them rest the stronger the flavor of the rub on the finished product. Now you want to mix up a basic dipping/breading station. Mix all your dry ingredients together in one bowl, put the Panko bread crumbs in another bowl, and put you egg and milk mixture in a third bowl. Take your chops out of the fridge and line everything up like this - Meat, Flour, Egg, Breadcrumbs. Now get a frying pan with high walls and toss in your lard. You may want more or less lard depending on the number of chops but I like the lard once it is melted to be just a little deeper than the width of the chops so it should be a bout a 1/4" or slightly more of lard in the pan (Id say slightly more). You can crank up the heat on the lard to 10 or so and you want the lard at about 375 or so - I think that is the sweet spot. I don't really use a thermometer. I just crank it up to the highest and as soon as I see any smoke at all Ill quickly turn it back from 10 to like 8 or 7.5\. Keep in mind when you add your meat to the oil it will quickly reduce the temp of the oil so you will have to increase the temp once you add meat. Coat your meat with the flour mixture, dip into the egg mixture, roll around in the bread crumb mixture, and then set it in the pan of hot lard/oil. Once you see the sides beginning to brown/golden you can flip the chop. If it isnt that perfectly golden color you are looking for you can always flip it back again - I found they cooked in 5-7 minutes and I was cooking three at a time. Remove the breaded chop from the pan and place on a plate lined with paper towels to absorb surface grease/oil. You can serve these breaded chops or "schnitzel" with sauerkraut or with BBQ sauce - or however you want them. Personally I like them with Rahm or "Hunter" sauce which is a German mushroom sauce you can usually find in just about any supermarket or you can always try and make your own. Mashpotato, Mac and Cheese, or any other starch works nicely with this dish. Personally, if I had my preference I would have it with homemade Spaetezel (a home made pasta) and brussel sprouts covered with a butter herb garlic sauce.
